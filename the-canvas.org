Hello, I'm +Bob Ross+ Michael Utz, and I'd like to welcome you to *The
Joy of Emacs*. I'd you to get out your brushes and canvas :art: and follow
along with us today.

If you're like me, you always /wanted/ to learn how your Emacs worked,
but it just seemed like too much of a hassle. Well, I'm here to tell
you, you *can* learn how Emacs works, and when you do, there's no end
to the joy it will bring to your life.

While we're learning, I'll include some inspirational quotes from Bob
Ross. Because everyone deserves a little happiness in their editor.

“I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the
'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.”

** Emacs & VIM

I used VIM for years, and I try to use it's keybindings
everywhere. Luckily, Emacs makes that super easy with a package called
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]].

** How to Get Around

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   “We don’t really know where this goes — and I’m not sure we really
   care.”
   #+END_QUOTE

   If you're new to Emacs and VIM, there's probably a lot of stuff
   going on that you don't know about. That's ok! Here's some basics
   to help you out:

   | Key | Cursor motion |
   |-----+---------------|
   | h   | Move left     |
   | j   | Move down     |
   | k   | Move up       |
   | l   | Move right    |

   To visit a link, put the cursor on [[https://zenofbobross.tumblr.com][a link like this]] and press the
   =Enter= or =Return= key. (This key is often referred to in the
   documentation as =RET=).

   If you want a fun way to learn how VIM motions work, I recommend
   checking out the online game [[https://vim-adventures.com][VIM Adventures]].
